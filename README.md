# zplots
 
a collection of plotting tools (and a few other useful functions) - all made through matplotlib (and numpy, scipy)

feel free to use anything - at best partly documented - if you use it a lot in published work you could acknowledge this package, or cite the papers which first used the particular plot style (you'll have to find them yourself though!)

the example ipynb contains a lot of the functionality - but to understand all the optional arguments etc you'll probably have to look at the code itself

feel free to ask question/suggest changes - i'll keep growing it myself occasionally too
